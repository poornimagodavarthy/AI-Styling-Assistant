by Poornima Godavarthy, Katy Hosokawa, Nidhi Raviprasad, and Ananya Thapar

## Overview

This project implements a fashion recommendation system using evolutionary algorithms based on user preferences collected through a quiz. The system suggests topwear and bottomwear items from a dataset based on user-provided style preferences.

## Features

- **Personalized Quiz**: Users are prompted to answer questions about their gender, preferred base color, season, and usage.
- **Evolutionary Algorithm**: Uses genetic algorithms to evolve and find the best matching fashion items based on user preferences and item attributes.
- **Image Retrieval**: Retrieves and displays images of the recommended topwear and bottomwear items.
- **User Satisfaction Feedback**: Allows users to provide feedback on recommended items to refine future recommendations.
